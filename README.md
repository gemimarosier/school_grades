You can click here to view my app on PythonAnywhere. http://gemimarosier.pythonanywhere.com/

This app was created to take a look into the all the schools that recieved an 'F' grade by the Florida Department of Education in 2015. 
I displayed this list in a map of Florida, so viewers can see where these schools are located. Under the map is be a list of schools. When a school is clicked on the list a profile will come up 
displaying information such as the what county the school is located, percentage of minority students, etc.
